/**
 * In-memory composer drafts, keyed by session id.
 *
 * SessionPane keeps the text you are typing in a React ref so retyping while
 * the pane stays mounted does not re-render on every keystroke. A plain ref
 * only lives as long as that one component instance though: closing a
 * session's pane (or moving it to another split) unmounts SessionPane, and
 * the ref - and whatever you had typed - is gone with no warning the moment
 * it remounts.
 *
 * This module-level map survives that, because it lives outside the React
 * tree for as long as the app process is running: the draft comes back when
 * the pane for that session opens again.
 *
 * Unsent attachments are stashed here when the Composer unmounts, so an
 * image-only draft comes back too.
 *
 * It does not survive an app restart or a full reload - that needs the
 * draft written into the session's persisted record on disk, which is a
 * separate, larger change (touches the Rust-side session_upsert schema
 * too).
