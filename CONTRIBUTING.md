# Contributing to ohmymonocode

This is an independently maintained personal fork of MonoCode. Keep changes
focused and follow [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md). Upstream issues, provider restrictions
and maintainer approvals are not prerequisites for work in this fork.

## Development

Use Node.js 24+, a stable Rust toolchain, native Tauri dependencies, and at least
one installed and authenticated provider CLI. Follow the [README](README.md#get-started)
for setup; use `npm ci` to install the locked dependencies.

| Directory | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `src/app/`, `src/features/` | Desktop shell and product features |
| `src/integrations/harness/core/`, `providers/` | Shared provider contracts and protocol adapters |
| `src/shared/`, `src/platform/tauri/` | Shared UI and native platform adapters |
| `src-tauri/`, `crates/` | Native desktop and shared Rust process management |
| `host/` | Shared sessions, assistant and workflow runtime |
| `src/mobile/`, `mobile/` | Mobile UI, native projects and build tools |

Pi and OMP share `piFamily.ts`; verify both when changing shared behavior.
Application-owned text follows the [localization guide](docs/localization.md).
Desktop and Host reuse adapters, but image persistence differs by runtime.

## Verification and delivery

Run the smallest existing checks that cover the change and record their results.
Documentation-only edits need link and formatting inspection, not application
test suites. Use `npm run check:web`, `npm run test:host` or `npm run build` when
their scope is relevant; run `npm run check:rust` for Rust changes. Do not claim
compatibility for provider or device combinations that were not exercised.

Builds and publication are manual, explicitly requested operations. Follow the
[build and update guide](docs/updates.md); pushing source and publishing a Release
are separate steps. Do not configure automatic LAN publication hooks.

For pull requests, describe the final behavior, relevant checks and limitations.
Use the [PR template](.github/pull_request_template.md); include screenshots when
they help explain a UI change. Keep unrelated work out of the patch.
